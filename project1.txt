 CSCE 315 PROJECT 1 (INDIVIDUAL)
 Section: ______________
 Due: 11:59 P.M. Friday, January 30, 2015

 "On my honor, as an Aggie, I have neither given nor received any unauthorized
 aid on any portion of the academic work included in this assignment."

 NOTE:  Please follow your lab instructor's directions for submitting your
 assignment through CSNET.  (Use VPN if you are off campus.)  ONLY
 ASSIGNMENTS SUBMITTED TO CSNET WILL BE GRADED!  Make a printout of each
 source file and staple it behind this cover sheet, unless your lab instructor
 directs otherwise.  Sign it and give it to your TA in lab or put it in your
 TA's mailbox in the corner of the 3rd floor of HRBB, near room 312.  IF YOU
 DO NOT TURN IN A SIGNED COVER SHEET YOUR WORK WILL NOT BE GRADED!

 NOTE:  This project will be graded on build.tamu.edu using g++ version
 4.9.2 with the -std=c++14 option, or javac and java.  You are free to develop
 your programs on any other platform, but it is your responsibility to make
 sure your programs also compile and execute correctly on build.tamu.edu as
 specified.

 NOTE:  Each file submitted (project1.cpp or Project1.java, etc.) must begin as
 follows:
 //Your name
 //Course and section number
 //Due: January 30, 2015 (or whatever the due date is)
 //Project1.java (or project1.cpp or whatever this file name is)

 The grade for this lab will be based on style (formatting, variable names,
 comments, etc.), syntax (no compilation or link errors), and performance on
 test cases (where "performance" is defined below).  Your grade for this project is:

 Style			/20
 Syntax			/30
 Performance		/50
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 Subotal		/100

____ Late penalty multiplier (.99 for 1 hour late, .98 for two hours late, etc.)

The purpose of this project is to evaluate your ability to design and write
good code.  You may use either C++ or Java with the compilers specified above.

Your program should read from the standard input a list of points
and find the shortest closed path connecting the points, in the shortest time.
The input will be the x and y coordinates of the points as non-negative
integers separated by white space (space, tab, newline, etc.); end of file is
indicated by Control-D for console input.  Any line of input beginning with #
is a comment, which your program should ignore.

For example, if the input is

# test case 1
# 4 points p0, p1, p2, p3
0	0
0	1
1	1
1	2
^D

the output should be

0
1
3
2
0
4.82843

since the shortest closed path is p0, p1, p3, p2, p0, and the path length is
4.82843.  Use exactly this format for output since it will be graded by
computer.

NOTE: The input file will contain up to 1000 points.

To simplify testing, put the input data in a text file named testcase1.txt and
run

./a.out < testcase1.txt	(for C++)

or

java Project1 < testcase1.txt	(for Java)

The performance will be scored by scaling path length times execution time,
with the smallest such product in the class getting the full 50 points for
best performance, and the largest such product in the class getting only 70%
of the 50 points (i.e., 35 points) for the worst performance.  If you write in
Java you will only be compared against the other Java programs, and similarly
for C++.

Follow a good style guide (e.g.,
http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.html or
http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/PPP-style.pdf for C++, or
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconvtoc-136057.html for Java).

Also follow these three rules:
1.  No more than one statement per line.
2.  No function longer than 24 lines (one terminal window).
3.  No line longer than 80 characters.

Name your program project1.cpp or Project1.java and submit this source file
using CSNET.
